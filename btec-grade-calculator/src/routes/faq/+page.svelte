        <svelte:fragment slot="content">Navigating the BTEC Grade Calculator may initially seem daunting, but fear not. Simply select the BTEC course type relevant to your studies and proceed to the
            <a href="/btec-grade-calculator/static" class="anchor">calculator section</a>. Once there, input your grades for the Mandatory unitsâ€”these are the units you must complete. If you have not yet received your grade, select "PENDING" without concern. Additionally, you'll be prompted to enter your grades for the optional units you're studying. Just select the unit name and input your grade. If you're unsure about the optional unit you're studying, you can leave it blank; our algorithms will still compute your grades accurately. Similarly, if you haven't received your grade for an optional unit, select "PENDING." After filling in your units and grades, simply click the calculate button, and your grades will be promptly displayed on the screen.

        <svelte:fragment slot="summary">What do the different grades mean?</svelte:fragment>
        <svelte:fragment slot="content">
            When utilizing the grade calculator, you'll encounter three distinct values: your current grade, your expected grade, and your maximum possible grade. Your current grade is computed from the grades of all the units you've completed thus far. Essentially, if you were to fail the remaining units, this would be the grade you'd receive (provided you still pass your mandatory units). Your expected grade is the grade our algorithms anticipate you to achieve. To calculate this value, we consider your performance thus far and the difficulty of your remaining units. Finally, your maximum grade represents the highest possible grade attainable given your existing grades. In essence, this is the grade you'd receive if you were to achieve the highest grade in your remaining units.
